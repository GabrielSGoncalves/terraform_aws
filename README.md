# Personal AWS infrastructure with Terraform
In this repository I create a cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform in order to practice IaC concepts.
The article ["An Introduction to Terraform" from Yevgeniy Brikman (Medium)](https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180) was used as a reference for developing the code of this repository.
